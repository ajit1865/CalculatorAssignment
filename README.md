## What is scala

Scala is a general-purpose programming language providing support for both object-oriented programming and functional programming. The language has a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions are aimed to address criticisms of Java.

## Question
Create an sbt project which will contain both java and scala code. Inside java, create two classes as follows 

- first one, 'calculator' class containing 4 methods, add, substract, multiply and divide. (Ensure to handle all types of cases).
- second class, 'storage' class, which just contains an array used to store elements. This class will contains several methods as well i.e. addElement, removeElement, removeAll, checkIfContains.

In Scala, implement the followings -

- Create a class exposing all the methods of 'calculator' class.
- Create a trait containing the methods defition only and create a new class extending the traits and these override methods will call the 'storage' class methos to perform operations.

## Question description


Created a class calculator which contains several methods :-

## methods
- addTwoNumbers()
- subtractionOfTwoNumbers()
- multiplicationOfTwoNumbers()
- divisioOfTwoNumbers()

by calling function and passing numbers as argument we get result as required.

### output of calculator



## Run Locally
